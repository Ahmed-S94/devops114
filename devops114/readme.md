What is DevOps?

Devops is a combination of two departments; Development and operations. The overall workflow emphasises the communication between both the IT professionals managing the environment and the software developers. Automation is essential as a DevOps engineer however fundamentally Devops involves combining development and operations into a singular continuous process to alleviate the blame culture that used to exist.





What are the Benefits of Devops?

	-Improved Communication: When different teams or departments work on a project, communication is key to its success. But people often get caught up in their day-to-day tasks and communications start to slip through the cracks. By using DevOps, teams can keep everyone in the loop and things get done quicker.

	- Scalability: Organizations can more easily scale their operations by Devops. This is because software testers and developers can quickly add or remove resources as needed in order to respond to changes in demand.

	- Better Quality Control: When a business is working with multiple teams and departments, quality control can be an issue. The best way to make sure that everything is done correctly and meets the standards of the business is to implement DevOps processes and cloud computing solutions into your development efforts. This helps ensure higher-quality products and fewer errors.

	-Reduced Costs: One of the biggest benefits of using DevOps is that it can help businesses save money. This means that businesses will spend less on rework and corrections. In addition, cloud computing can help businesses stay within budget by allowing them to pay only for the resources they need.



What are the roles of a devops?

A Devops engineer role can vary on a number of factors however these are the main aspects the role entails;

 	-Testing: Tests code, processes, and deployments to identify ways to streamline and minimize errors.

	-Deployment: Uses configuration management software to automatically deploy updates and fixes into the production environment.

	-Development: Develops, codes, builds, installs, configures, and maintains IT solutions.
